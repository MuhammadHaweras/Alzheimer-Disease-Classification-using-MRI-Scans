Different mechanisms can be applied for
diagnosis and detection of Alzheimer’s disease, among which is the detection through the MRI scans of the brain.
Different image processing techniques have been employed for the detection of Alzheimer disease from the MRI
Scans. For the past several years, Deep Learning Models have outdated all the previous techniques and now deep
learning models just need dataset and they themselves learn and extracts feature from that data and are able to
correctly classify any MRI Scan into 1 of the 4 possible classes relating to Alzheimer’s detection. We manually
extracted first and second-order statistical features from MRI scan images for binary and multiclass classification.
These features were used to train various machine learning classifiers, and the best classifier was selected based on
their performance. Additionally, we implemented a deep learning-based approach using the AlexNet architecture for
multiclass classification. The classification results of the AlexNet model were compared with traditional machine
learning approaches to assess its effectiveness in accurately identifying different stages of Alzheimer’s disease.
